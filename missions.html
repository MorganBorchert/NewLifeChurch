                        <div><p><strong>Operation Waitress:</strong><br><br>Each year during the months of November and early December, NLCC takes an offering to purchase debit cards from Target to give to single-working mothers.  We give each of than a $50 gift card for purchasing medicine, food, clothes or Christmas gifts for their children.  We have worked with single-working mothers at Logan's, Chili's, Outback, Cracker Barrel, Applebee's, The Pit Grill, and Johnny Cariono's.  In eleven years, NLCC has given more than $32,000 dollars to this needy moms.  We ave helped more than 600 single-working mothers.  We tell them:  "We know that times are tough and they are facing unbelievable challenges simply to survive.  We want them to know that God has not forgotten them and that He wants us to be His arms and feet today to bring some help into their lives.  I share that NLCC is a small congregation with a huge heart of middle class hard working people who simply want to help them financially right now.  We do not expect them come to our church nor even attend one time.  We simply want them to know God is alive and still cares for them."  Many simply break down crying.  Many have said that they did not believe God existed anymore.  Many have been beaten and mistreated by men.  We have helped many with children only a few weeks old. We have helped airlift a son involved in a car wreck to a major trauma center.  Out ladies have made several diaper bags for working moms who were pregnant.  We have personally counseled several of them.  We have seen several go from recovering addicts who have lost their children temporarily to successful school teachers and nurses and out in the business world as administrative assistant.</p></div>

                        <div><p><strong>Saving Souls Foot Ministry For Seniors:</strong><br><br>Four or five times a year about a dozen New Lifers go into the local convalescent homes to minister to the citizens living there.  We try out best to pamper them and visit with them to hear their stories.  We wash and massage their feet and then use hot towels to make them feel good; look for dilates; and have a doctor with us to clip their toenails. We provide a healthy breakfast of fruit and snacks.  We listen to their stories and when permitted might tell them about God's love and presence for them; however, we mainly listen and befriend them for a day.  We have done this for eight years.</p></div>

                        <div><p><strong>Water Missions International:</strong><br><br>For three years NLCC has worked with Water Missions. It was began by a group of engineers who simply wanted to help with the world-wide water crisis.  92% of ever dollar given goes directly to drill wells and set up safe efficient water systems in third world countries and train them how to use them.  Over half of the baby deaths in the world and almost half of all children's deaths in the world are directly related to contaminate water. The biggest cause of death in the world is contaminated water. The easiest and cheapest way to improve the standard of living for all the world is providing clean safe water.  For a nation that wastes so much water in our showers, in our bath tubs, brushing our teeth, flushing our commode, and watering our lawns, we have no idea of the world crisis concerning water.  NLCC has paid for building three complete water systems in 3 different villages in Uganda and thus providing clean safe water for more than 30,000 people.  Often we challenge our people to drink nothing but water for two weeks just to remind them of the need and crisis around the world.</p></div>

                        <div><p><strong>Bags of Hope:</strong><br><br>For the two poorest parishes in all of the USA, in northern Louisiana, we work with Together for Hope and provide backpacks with enough school supplies for an entire year.  One year we helped 65 elementary age students.  They need pencils, pens, tablets, scissors, glue, loose-leaf paper. Forget computers and technology. These students don't even have what most of took to school in the 1940's.  These two parishes are East Carrol and Tensas.  The poverty there is unbelievable.</p></div>
